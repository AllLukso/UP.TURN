# UP.TURN Digital Asset Backed Artist Tokens and Infrastructure
For the first time, artists will be able to sell tokens backed by their catalogue of digital assets. In this world of intangible value it is hard to truly know what gives an NFT or token its value, or whether there is any backing other than speculation. The UP.TURN concept creates a new pathway for artists to capitalise on their catalogue of digital assets. Artist income has always been  at the forefront of the music industry, especially on the independent side. With roughly 70% of revenue into the music industry being controlled by the major 4 labels, it has never been more important for an artist to be in direct contact with their fans and their income.

With the emergence of NFTs and AR, VR,  Metaverse tech. The value attributed to digital assets like music, artwork, fashion and merchandise has never been higher and will continue to grow in the coming years.

The UP.TURN decentralised infrastructure we’ve built will solve an important issue for artists. How to raise funds for their livelihood and artwork from their art. Starting in music and eventually opening this up to small time creators and collectors alike, UP.TURN plans to index collections and allow fans of creators to “buy in” their favourite artists and collectors.

## Artist Tokens [AT]
Artists Tokens (LSP7) are “Social Tokens” created by an artist. These tokens represent a stake in the issuers digital asset catalogue. A financial instrument created to give fans a way to “invest” in their favourite artists before they make it big, or a way to buy a creator's entire catalogue instead of buying only one single piece [similar to an ETF in stocks, which is essentially a parcel of a group of companies, in this case the parcel is full of digital assets].


An artist will divest their rights to income from their digital assets for a price they see fit, variables including vesting [12-24 month], % of total circulation to be sold, % of DA sale to be lock in vested liquidity (an automatic “share buy back” mechanism to keep the token value steady), Sale amount, Sale price, Token Burning, will all be included in the onboard process.
 
The vesting mechanism allows an artist and the future rights holders to access the funds from their digital asset sale over a period of [for example] 12-24 months, to ensure a steady token value and a steady income over that period. This gives the token extra security and assists in keeping values steady by minimising paper hands. 

### Reversible ICO
Users that want to return their commitment to an artist via the sale of artist token
can return their tokens inside the sale contract, having similar functionality to 
the rICO. When a sale for an artist token is created the rICO information is set, for example
how long each wait interval (time before artist can claim their next payment), how much money
an artist can recieve per interval and more.


## Digital Assets [DA]
DA’s (LSP8) minted through our infrastructure will be the assets utilising our AT indexing features. These assets can include Merchandise, Music and Royalties, Artwork, Video and any other type of NFT attributed to a creator.


## Marketplace
Our Marketplace has not been developed for this iteration of the front end however the smart contracts have been written and tested. We have kept in mind the future functionality of UP’s allowing users and owners to sell assets directly from their UniversalProfile. We would also like to incorporate this marketplace with UniversalPage, by giving artists the ability to link their UP and UPage assets with our marketplace and Social Token infrastructure.
Can you please add some details here about marketplace Tech and standards etc]


## AT Exchange
The artist token exchange enables tokens to recieved locked and unlocked liquidity
by users and contracts. This is highly important as this allows an artist token
to gain locked liquidity for a certain amount of time via artist token (LSP7) sales and 
digital asset (LSP8) sales.

## Staking

For users to recieve royalties from marketplace sales and artist fees they must stake 
the associated artist token. This allows for a easy and concise way to track as well
send out fees for each user
